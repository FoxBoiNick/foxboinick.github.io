# Privacy Policy for Pesky Bird

_Last updated: May 15, 2025_

## 1. Controller & Contact
**Operator:** Individual (“me”)  
**Contact e-mail:** pesky@nick.ad  

## 2. Information We Collect
When you use Pesky Bird in a Discord server, we automatically process the following data:
- **Markov Chain Training Data:**  
  - Word-pair tuples (word, next word, appearance count) derived from server chat.  
  - _No raw messages are stored._
- **Deletion Tracking:** Message IDs to support message-deletion actions.  
- **Opt-Out Status:** User IDs plus a Boolean flag for “opted out” users.  
- **Attachment Links:** URLs of images or files you submit for image-generation commands.  
- **Server Configuration:** Guild IDs and per-guild/channel config settings.

## 3. Purpose of Processing
- **Text Generation:** Generate novel, Markov-chain–based messages that mimic prior server content.  
- **Bot Functionality:**  
  - Tracking and execution of message-deletion commands  
  - Managing per-guild/channel settings  
  - Honoring user “opt-out” requests  
  - Handling image-generation inputs

## 4. Data Storage & Retention
- **Storage Location:** Self-hosted servers under the Controller’s management.  
- **Retention Period:**  
  - Model word-pairs, Attachments, guild configurations: retained indefinitely while the server remains active; purged 30 days after removal from a server.  
  - Opt-out flags: retained only as long as needed; deleted promptly when no longer required.  
- **Anonymization:** Raw words are immediately transformed into word-pair counts; no personally identifiable text is stored.

## 5. Data Sharing & Transfers
- Pesky Bird does **not** share data with any third parties.  
- There are **no** cross-border transfers (all data remains on the Controller’s self-hosted infrastructure).

## 6. User Rights & Controls
- **Server-Level Reset:** Server owners/administrators may request a full dataset reset (purging all model data for that guild).  
- **Individual Erasure:** Training data is anonymized and not linked to raw messages; individual users cannot request partial erasure.  
- **How to Request:** Send a request via email (pesky@nick.ad) or DM the Controller in the official support server. A reset will be performed as soon as practical.

## 7. Cookies or Tracking
- The bot and any associated website or dashboard **do not** use cookies or any other form of tracking.

## 8. Minors
- Per Discord’s Terms of Service, users under 13 years of age are prohibited. Pesky Bird does not knowingly collect or process data from minors.

## 9. Legal Basis & Compliance
- Controller targets compliance with **UK GDPR** and **EU GDPR**.  
- **Lawful Basis:** Legitimate interest in running and improving the bot, balanced with data minimization and user controls.

## 10. Liability Disclaimer
Pesky Bird’s outputs are generated automatically by a Markov Chain algorithm trained on public chat history.  
The Controller **accepts no liability** for any statements, jokes, or content produced by the bot.

## 11. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time.  
Any material changes will be announced in the official Pesky Bird Discord support server.
